							<h1>A Collection of Personal Hobbyist Projects</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="../images/hobby/cad2.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>
								Many of my hobbyist projects are poorly documented so these are just the highlights of what I have to show. I do not tend to document my personal work in the interest of maximizing the free time I have available. On the pareto optimal boundary of time vs. quality of work, I typically only take things far up the time axis when the project is for school or to help out friends and family. "Perfect is the enemy of good" -Voltaire.

								The pictures above and below are screenshots from a recent part I created for a friend of mine. The goal was mount his large brick shaped lipo battery to his swoopy framed beach cruiser as part of creating a custom E-bike. The mount was split into two parts. The bottom part served as a mount, adapting the swoopy top tube of the frame into a flat spot to mount the battery. This mounting section was permanently secured to the bike.
							</p>

							<p>
								The second part was the battery box which was sealed shut once the battery was securely fitted inside. This top box had feet which could slide down into the mounting part to restrain the battery on the bike while still allowing it the be removed for charging. The battery box also has a hole where a lock was installed so the battery could not be slid off the mount when locked.

								The following picture is a wiring schematic I made to keep track of where to solder connections for a flight controller. This is the complete wiring for an RC place I was assembling. The connections were basic but there were many and a color coordinated reference was invaluable to create.

								This next picture is part of a custom mouse I was making for myself. It used a 3D printed baseplate to place the PCB of a wireless mouse into the shell of another with a better shape. This was done to make my favorite mouse wireless because there was not a wireless version. Doing this also made the mouse slightly lighter and it gave me the opportunity to switch out the scroll wheel and switches with ones I prefer.

								This next photo was only taken so I could remember how to reassemble my laptop. This is my laptop motherboard after being removed from the body. It was necessary to remove the motherboard and flip it over in order to access the m.2 SSD slot. I wanted to upgrade my laptop's memory capacity as well as replace both fan assemblies and the battery all in one go to minimize how many times I needed to open it up to maintain it.

								The picture below was taken just to remember how to reassemble my motorcycle. Here I was swapping out my handlebars with a set that was much more comfortable. This also required installing longer throttle and clutch cables and longer brake lines. There were a lot of components mounted on the bars which I wanted to remember the placement of.
							</p>

								The final picture is of a motorcycle I have since sold. This photo was also taken in an attempt to remember the placement of parts. Here, I was replacing one of the plastic fairings the previous owner had broken. The part I replaced had many brackets holding other pieces together and by replacing the one piece, the rest of the fairings were able to fit together as tight as it was when it was new. This also meant that I had to disassemble a lot of small and large plastic components in order to replace just the one.
